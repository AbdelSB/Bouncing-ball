# Bouncing-ball
## This project is MDN final assessment of the JS objects section (2020)

In this assessment I had to create a simple game exploring JS objects and inheritence. Most functions were provided by MDN team and were not made by me, in this assessment my contribution was strictly limited to building objects inheriting from a parent object (consequently defining their properties and methods), while updating parts of the functions as needed for the assessment.
